            <h3>My Background</h3>
                <p>Through my work experience, I have developed a diverse list of career skills. I was an teacher and tutor for 3 years. THrough teaching I learned the importance of guidance and supporting the different learning styles of students in kindergarten through high school.</p>
                <p>After I left teaching, I began to become very interested in technology and I knew I wanted to work in it in some way. I worked as a technical support agent for 1 year but it was not quite the challenge I was looking for.</p>
                <p>I am a knowledge seeker and after I parted ways with customer service, I decided to take the time to explore knowledge seeking and researching on my own. Because of this, I was able to teach my self many technical skills including responsive web design, cloud computing, and data analytics. This led me to my current apprenticeship with HP.</p>
